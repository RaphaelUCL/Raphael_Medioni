## About Me & My Projects

This GitHub repository presents a selection of projects developed as part of both academic training and personal exploration in applied mathematics and quantitative finance.

The projects are primarily theoretical in nature, and I intend to further develop some of them through internships or during my future academic studies. They aim to bridge theoretical foundations with practical applications, and are designed to be usable with real-world data.

If you would like to discuss any of these projects, share feedback, or get in touch, please feel free to reach out â€” my contact details are available at the bottom of the page.

## Overview

Currently in my final year of a Bachelor of Arts and Sciences at UCL, I specialise in mathematics and civil engineering. Iâ€™m passionate about science and about applying mathematics, statistics, and engineering principles to finance.

I am currently writing my final-year dissertation on algorithmic market making, with a focus on developing a system that could be deployed on Polymarket.

Deeply fascinated by entrepreneurship, my long-term goal is to launch my own proprietary trading firm.

Outside of academics, Iâ€™m passionate about poker, skiing, and contemporary art.

## Selected Projects

### â–¸ [Intro to Market Making](https://github.com/RaphaelUCL/all/blob/main/Intro_to_market_making.ipynb)  
**Goal:** Explore the Avellaneda-Stoikov market making model through simulation and parameter analysis.  
**Highlights:**
- Implementation of a dynamic quoting strategy based on inventory and market volatility  
- Simulation of asset prices using Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)  
- Study of how parameters like `gamma`, `dt`, and `lambda_rate` affect profitability and risk  
- Visualization of quotes, inventory, and PnL over time

### â–¸ [Implied Volatility Surface Construction](https://github.com/RaphaelUCL/all/blob/main/implied_vol_surface_analysis.ipynb)  
**Goal:** Construct and visualize an implied volatility surface from synthetic option data using interpolation techniques.  
**Highlights:**
- Generation of realistic mock option data (strike, maturity, implied volatility)  
- Visualization of volatility smiles across different maturities  
- Interactive and static 3D visualizations of the implied volatility surface using Plotly and Matplotli

### â–¸ [Option Greeks Visualiser](https://github.com/RaphaelUCL/all/blob/main/Option_Greeks_Visualiser_.ipynb)  
**Goal:** Build a tool to compute and visualise European option prices and Greeks under the Black-Scholes model.  
**Highlights:**
* Calculate European option prices under the Black-Scholes model,
* Compute the standard Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, Rho),
* Visualise these Greeks in 2D and 3D (static and interactive).

### â–¸ [Portfolio Optimisation with Markowitz Efficient Frontier](https://github.com/RaphaelUCL/Raphael_Medioni/blob/main/Portfolio_Optimisation_with_Markowitz_Efficient_Frontier.ipynb)  
**Goal:**  Build a simulator of Markowitz's Modern Portfolio Theory using real financial data from `yfinance`, to explore optimal asset allocation under different constraints.
**Highlights:**
- Simulation of the Efficient Frontier using thousands of random portfolios  
- Portfolio optimisation based on Sharpe Ratio, volatility, or target expected return  
- Real data integration using `yfinance` to analyse historical performance and asset behaviour
