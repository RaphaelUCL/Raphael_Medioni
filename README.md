# About Me & My Projects

This GitHub repository showcases a selection of projects developed as part of both academic training and personal exploration in applied mathematics, quantitative finance, and programming.

The projects are primarily theoretical, and I plan to further develop some of them through internships or during my future academic studies. They aim to tackle real-world problems using advanced mathematical tools and quantitative techniques.

If you'd like to discuss any of these projects, share feedback, or get in touch, feel free to reach out â€” my contact information is available at the bottom of the page.

## Overview

Currently in my final year of a Bachelor of Arts and Sciences at UCL, I specialize in mathematics and civil engineering. I'm passionate about science and about applying mathematics, statistics, and engineering principles to finance.

I'm currently writing my final year thesis on algorithmic market making, with a focus on building a system that could be used on Polymarket.

Deeply fascinated by entrepreneurship, my long-term goal is to launch my own proprietary trading shop.

Outside of academics, Iâ€™m passionate about poker, perfumery, and contemporary art.
